Insert an assignment statement that contains an `=` operator. An assignment statement is used to define a new variable or set the value of an existing variable.

More fundamentally, an assignment statement sets or re-sets the value stored in the storage location denoted by a variable name. For example, consider the statement `x = 10`. If the variable `x` does not exist in the current scope, then a new variable is created in storage and the value `10` is then copied into that storage location. If the variable `x` exists already, then the value `10` is copied into the existing storage location, overwriting any value that exists there already.
