# VARIABLE  
  
**Description:** Insert an assignment statement that contains an `=` operator. An assignment statement is used to define a new variable or set the value of an existing variable.\n \nMore fundamentally, an assignment statement sets and/or re-sets the value stored in the storage location denoted by a variable name. For example, consider the statement `x = 10`. If the variable `x` does not exist in the current scope, then a new variable is created in storage and the value `10` is then copied into that storage location. If the variable exists already, then the value `10` is copied into the existing storage location , overwriting any value that exists there already.  
  
**Examples:**  
  * my_var = 123  
    Sets the variable `my_var` to the value `123`.  
  * my_list[2] = 123  
    In the list `my_list`, sets the third item in the list to the value `123`.  
  * my_dict['abc'] = 123  
    In the dictionary `my_dict`, sets a key-value pair, where the key is `abc` and the value is `123`..
