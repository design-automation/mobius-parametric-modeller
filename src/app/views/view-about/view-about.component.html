            <h3>What is Möbius  Modeller?</h3>
            <p>Möbius Modeller is an open-source web application for 3D parametric modelling. 
                The app allows users to create modelling procedures using the Öbi visual programming language.
                In the Öbi language, your write computer programs by drawing flowcharts and by defining procedures
                using 'click and fill-in-the-blanks' coding. </p>
            <p>Since Möbius Modeller is a web app, you can just go ahead an use it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The software is free, so there is need to pay!</li>
                <li>The software is online, so there is need to install anything on your computer.</li>
                <li>The software does not require authentication, so there is no need to create an account or to log in.</li>
                <li>Code is executed in your browser, so there is no need to worry about network speed.</li>
                <li>Your data never leaves your browser, so there is no need to worry about data privacy and security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Möbius models that you create can be 
                published as interactive web pages, allowing visitors on the web to explore the models.</p>
    
    
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>The best way to start using Möbius Modeller is to explore some of the models in the gallery.
                After that you can dive in and start creating your own flowcharts and procedures. </p>
            <p>The icons at the top of the page allow you to navigate into your model, from the top level 
                dashboard down the procedures at the bottom level.</p>

            <table class='key'>

                    <td>Each model has its own dashboard that exposes a set of parameters, that can be set using sliders and UI components.
                    To access the dashboard, click</td>

                    <td>Each node in the model has its own procedure, defined using the Öbi language.
                        To access the procedure, click</td>
                    <td><mat-icon svgIcon="cEditor" (click)='routeTo("/editor")'></mat-icon></td>

                    <td>To execute the Öbi flowchart, click the execute button. This will transpile your Öbi code 
                        into Javascript an execute it in your browser. </td>

                        the console in case there were any errors.  </td>
