The `entity@name` expression is used to get attributes from entities in the model. For example:

* `pgon1@abc` gets the value of an attribute called `abc` from the polygon that is stored in the variable `pgon1`. (Note that if an attribute with that name does not exist, then an error will be thrown.)
* `posi1@xyz` gets the value of an attribute called `xyz` from the position that is stored in the variable `posi1`. ((Note that the `xyz` attribute is a built in attribute that stores the location of a position.)
