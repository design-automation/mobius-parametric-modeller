The app allows users to create modelling procedures using the Öbi visual programming language.\\r\\n                In the Öbi language, your write computer programs by drawing flowcharts and by defining procedures\\r\\n                using 'click and fill-in-the-blanks' coding. </p>\\r\\n            <p>Since Möbius Modeller is a web app, you can just go ahead an use it.</p>\\r\\n            <ul>\\r\\n                <li>The software is free, so there is need to pay!</li>\\r\\n                <li>The software is online, so there is need to install anything on your computer.</li>\\r\\n                <li>The software does not require authentication, so there is no need to create an account or to log in.</li>\\r\\n                <li>Code is executed in your browser, so there is no need to worry about network speed.</li>\\r\\n                <li>Your data never leaves your browser, so there is no need to worry about data privacy and security.</li>\\r\\n            </ul>\\r\\n            <p>The Möbius models that you create can be \\r\\n                published as interactive web pages, allowing visitors on the web to explore the models.</p>\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n

creating your own flowcharts and procedures. </p>\\r\\n            <p>The icons at the top of the page allow you to navigate into your model, from the top level \\r\\n                dashboard down
