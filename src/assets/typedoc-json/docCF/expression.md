# EXPRESSION  
  
**Description:** Opens up a dialog box for creating expressions.\n \nAn expression is a combination of one or more constants, variables, functions, and operators that can be evaluated to produce another value.\n \n== Simple Expressions ==\n \nexample of simple expressions are `2 + 2`, which evaluates to `4`, and `1 == 2`, which evaluates to `false`. Expressions can also contain variables, for exaple is the variable `x` exists in the current scope, and has a value of `10`, then the expression `x + 2` will evaluate to `12`. \n \n== Expressions with Functions ==\n \nAn expression can also contain inline functions, such as `sqrt(9)` which evaluates to `3`. Functions can also be nested inside one another, for example, `round(sqrt(20))` evaluates to `4`. \n \nNote that all inline functions return a value. \n \n== Expressions with Spatial Information Queries == \n \nThe Obi language also supports a number of shortcus for querying entities in the spatial information model. \n \n * The `#XX` and `entity#XX` expressions are used to get a list of entities from the model.\n * The `entity@name` expression is used to get attributes from entities in the model.\n * The `?@name == value` expression is used to filter a list of entities based on attribute values.
