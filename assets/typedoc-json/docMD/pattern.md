## Bezier  
  
  
**Description:** Creates positions in an Bezier curve pattern. Returns a list of new positions.
The Bezier is created as either a qadratic or cubic Bezier. It is always an open curve.


The input is a list of XYZ coordinates (three coords for quadratics, four coords for cubics).
The first and last coordinates in the list are the start and end positions of the Bezier curve.
The middle coordinates act as the control points for controlling the shape of the Bezier curve.


For the quadratic Bezier, three XYZ coordinates are required.
For the cubic Bezier, four XYZ coordinates are required.


For more information, see the wikipedia article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">B%C3%A9zier_curve</a>.

  
  
**Parameters:**  
  * *coords:* A list of XYZ coordinates (three coords for quadratics, four coords for cubics).  
  * *num_positions:* Number of positions to be distributed along the Bezier.  
  
**Returns:** Entities, a list of positions.  
**Examples:**  
  * coordinates1 = pattern.Bezier([[0,0,0], [10,0,50], [20,0,10]], 20)

## Nurbs  
  
  
**Description:** Creates positions in an NURBS curve pattern, by using the XYZ positions as control points.
Returns a list of new positions.


The positions are created along the curve at equal parameter values.
This means that the euclidean distance between the positions will not necessarily be equal.


The input is a list of XYZ coordinates that will act as control points for the curve.
If the curve is open, then the first and last coordinates in the list are the start and end positions of the curve.


The number of positions should be at least one greater than the degree of the curve.


The degree (between 2 and 5) of the urve defines how smooth the curve is.
Quadratic: degree = 2
Cubic: degree = 3
Quartic: degree = 4.

  
  
**Parameters:**  
  * *coords:* A list of XYZ coordinates (must be at least three XYZ coords).  
  * *degree:* The degree of the curve, and integer between 2 and 5.  
  * *close:* Enum, 'close' or 'open'  
  * *num_positions:* Number of positions to be distributed along the Bezier.  
  
**Returns:** Entities, a list of positions.  
**Examples:**  
  * coordinates1 = pattern.Nurbs([[0,0,0], [10,0,50], [20,0,10]], 20)  
    Creates a list of 20 positions distributed along a Bezier curve pattern.

## Interpolate  
  
  
**Description:** Creates positions in an spline pattern. Returns a list of new positions.
The spline is created using the Catmull-Rom algorithm.
It is a type of interpolating spline (a curve that goes through its control points).


The input is a list of XYZ coordinates. These act as the control points for creating the Spline curve.
The positions that get generated will be divided equally between the control points.
For example, if you define 4 control points for a cosed spline, and set 'num_positions' to be 40,
then you will get 8 positions between each pair of control points,
irrespective of the distance between the control points.


The spline curve can be created in three ways: 'centripetal', 'chordal', or 'catmullrom'.
